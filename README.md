# todo-app

https://maaxli.github.io/todo-app/dist/index.html

This project is mainly for me to practice JavaScript, particularly with respect to:
- Classes, modules, factory functions, etc.
- OOP design principles, particularly Single Responsibility

I will also be able to practice the following skills which I have recently learned:
- HTML
- CSS
- webpack
- git branching

Things that I've learned through this project:
1. Planning out the project's file structure/OOP design is extremely helpful in the long run. In the future, I should also consider letting the `display` class handle even more (all?) of the event listeners.
2. Be extra thoughtful when naming variables and constants, especially when objects/nodes can be very similar. Ie: task (object) vs task list (nodelist) vs the list that holds the tasks (`ul` element)
3. Most importantly, I've become a lot more comfortable with using JavaScript to create dynamic webpages that the client can interact with: Adding listeners, creating new elements, interacting with the DOM, etc.

If I were to continue working on this project I would:
- Implement a modal form to be used when clients create/edit tasks
- Implement a better way for users to input dates
- Create the Features and About pages that I originally planned for

I am choosing to stop working on this project and to learn about other topics in web development so that I can create bigger and better things in the future!
