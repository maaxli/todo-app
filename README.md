# todo-app

This project is mainly for me to practice JavaScript, particularly with respect to:
- Classes, modules, factory functions, etc.
- OOP design principles, particularly Single Responsibility

I will also be able to practice the following skills which I have recently learned:
- HTML
- CSS
- webpack
- git branching
